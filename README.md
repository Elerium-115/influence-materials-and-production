## Materials & Production Tools

- **Raw Materials**  
View the raw materials available on each asteroid by spectral type.
  - Spectral Types:
    - Selecting one or more spectral types will highlight the raw materials that can be mined from them.
  - Raw Materials:
    - Selecting a raw material will highlight the spectral types from which it can be mined.

- **Materials Ratios**  
View the ratios of raw materials from a collection of asteroids, relative to the surface area of each spectral-type.

- **Products**  
View the products that can be made on each asteroid by spectral type.
  - Spectral Types:
    - Selecting one or more spectral types will highlight the products that can be made on those asteroid types.
    - Select a single spectral type to see which products can be made entirely on a single asteroid of that type.
    - Select multiple spectral types to allow production chains to extend over all those asteroid types.
  - Products:
    - Selecting a product will highlight the spectral types on which it can be made.
    - The entire production chain of the selected product can be made on any single one of the highlighted asteroid types.
    - Faded products can NOT be made on a single asteroid type.

- **Production Chains**  
View the production chains for each material and finished good.

- **Production Planner**  
Plan your production chain for a specific product.
  - Select any other products from the chain, that you also plan to produce.
  - All the remaining items will need to be obtained from a marketplace or other players.
  - They will also need to be delivered to the buildings where you plan to produce the selected items.

- **Asteroids Planner**  
The Asteroids Planner allows players, or alliances, to plan their production chains across multiple asteroids:
  - Add in-game asteroids, or create "mock rocks".
  - Plan one or more production chains, on each asteroid.
  - Connect your wallet, to automatically save your plan.
